# Human-Activity-Recognition-NN


Human Activity Recognition (HAR) belongs to the class of supervised learning with the objective of automatic recognition of physical activities performed by humans. Activity Recognition aims to predict human movements usually based on sensor data, such as a smartphone gyroscope.

 In this analysis, a dataset consisting of signals from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope carried by 30 participants of men and women when performing different activities is categorised using neural networks.
